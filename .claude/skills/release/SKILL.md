# Release Process

Follow these steps in order when preparing a new release.

## 1. Determine the Version

Check the current version in `Cargo.toml` and the git tags. The new version must follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **patch** (0.1.0 -> 0.1.1): bug fixes, dependency updates, no API changes
- **minor** (0.1.0 -> 0.2.0): new features, backwards-compatible API additions
- **major** (0.1.0 -> 1.0.0): breaking changes

If the user hasn't specified which bump, recommend one based on the changes since the last tag and confirm before proceeding.

## 2. Bump Version in Cargo.toml

Update the `version` field in `Cargo.toml`. Run `cargo check` to ensure `Cargo.lock` updates cleanly.

## 3. Commit

Create a single commit with message: `Release v<version>`

Stage only `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` (if changed).

## 4. Tag

Create an annotated tag with release notes as the message. Inspect `git log <last-tag>..HEAD` and write user-facing release notes in the tag message.

### Tag Message Format

```
v<version>

### Added
- Description of new feature

### Changed
- Description of change

### Fixed
- Description of fix
```

Use only the categories that have entries. Order: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security. Write in imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature"). Focus on user-facing changes, skip internal-only changes. Prefix breaking changes with **BREAKING:**.

### Creating the Tag

Use `git tag -a v<version> -F -` with a heredoc to pass the message.

## 5. Push

Push both the commit and the tag. The release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) triggers on `v*` tags and builds binaries for all targets automatically.

```sh
git push && git push --tags
```

Always confirm with the user before pushing.
